#PIP

PIP is a tiny application framework built for people who use a LAMP stack. PIP aims to be as simple as possible to set up and use.

Visit [http://gilbitron.github.com/PIP](http://gilbitron.github.com/PIP/) for more information and documentation.

This particular version leans on namespaces, a particular feature in PHP 5.3, which allow the final programmer (yes, you) to use same names for a controller and a model for example.

## Requirements

* PHP 5.3 or greater
* MySQL 4.1.2 or greater
* The mod_rewrite Apache module

## Installation

* Download PIP and extract
* Navigate to `application/config/config.php` and fill in your `base_url`
* You are ready to rock! Point your browser to your `base_url` and hopefully see a welcome message.
